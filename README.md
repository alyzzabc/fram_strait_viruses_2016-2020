# Arctic Ocean virus communities: seasonality, bipolarity, and prokaryotic interactions

This repository includes the scripts and workflows used for data analysis for the pre-print: Arctic Ocean virus communities: seasonality, bipolarity, and prokaryotic interactions. Link:

The analysis is based on long-read (Pac Bio) metagenomic sequences from a 4-year time-series in the Fram Strait, Arctic Ocean.
